# A class is like a blueprint for creating objects. An object has properties and methods(functions) associated with it. Almost everything in Python is an object

# Create class
class User:
  # Constructor
  def __init__(self, name, email, age):
    self.name = name
    self.email = email
    self.age = age

  def greeting(self):
    return f'My name is {self.name} and I am {self.age}'

  def has_birthday(self):
    self.age += 1



#  Init user object
brad = User('Brad Traversy', 'brad@gmail.com', 37)


brad.has_birthday()
print(brad.greeting())
